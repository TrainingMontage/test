 * A simple class to demonstrate some JavaDoc, among other tools.
 * These tools could include:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Google's style guide. I think there's a tool to automatically enforce this.
 * <li> JUnit, the unit-testing framework for Java.
 * <li> Eventually, a Java build tool of some kind (Gradle, Maven, whatever).
 * <li> Travis CI, which is going to build everything, run our tests, 
 *      tell us if they fail, build the docs, and push them to a GitHub Pages site.
 * </ol>
