## Dependencies

### Gradle

[Website](https://gradle.org/)

Gradle seems like a useful tool for build management and automation. It integrates with TravisCI and will handle building, running tests, and generating javadocs. There are some basic command alias' setup in the makefile for easy use. For a more complete set of commands, see [the docs](https://gradle.org/docs/).
