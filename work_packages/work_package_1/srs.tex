\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
The product whose software requirements are specified in this document is the
Training Montage Rail Simulator (TMRS). This SRS covers the functional and 
non-functional requirements, design contraints, and funcitonal limitations that
will be observed during the development of this project. This SRS will encompass
the entire system, and will include specific requirements, constraints, and 
limitations for each sub-system.

\section{Document Conventions}
The following acronyms will be used throughout the paper:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item TMRS - Training Montage Rail Simulator
  \item CTC - Centralized Traffic Control
\end{enumerate}

$<$Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when 
writing this SRS, such as fonts or highlighting that have special significance.  
For example, state whether priorities  for higher-level requirements are assumed 
to be inherited by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement 
is to have its own priority.$>$

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This document is intended as a part of the contractual agreement between Training
Montage and their client for the TMRS software package. It will be used as reference
by developers, project managers, testers, and the client.

It is suggested that the user read over the project scope and perspective, then
visit the UI design prototype included in the Appendix. The UI design prototype 
will give a good sense of how users will interact with the software, and of what
capabilities are provided by the system. After reviewing the UI design prototype,
proceed to read the rest of the document in the order that it's presented.

\section{Project Scope}
$<$Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, 
including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to 
corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document 
is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.$>$

\section{References}
$<$List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may 
include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements 
specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide 
enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, 
including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.$>$


\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
$<$Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.  
For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product 
family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained 
product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the 
requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and 
identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major 
components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external 
interfaces can be helpful.$>$

\section{Product Functions}
$<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user 
perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary 
(such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them 
understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of 
related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram 
or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
This produce is expected to be used by the following classes of users:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Dispatcher
    \item Wayside Engineer
    \item Train Conductor
\end{enumerate}

It is expected none of these user classes to have technical expertise. As such,
each user will be provided with an graphical user interface that allows full
functionality of each module.

It is, however, expected that Wayside Engineers are experts both on a section
of track and in writing PLC code. All uploaded code is considered vital.

\section{Operating Environment}
The software will operate on the Java Virtual Machine. The Java Virtual Machine
can be installed on computers with a Pentium 2 266 MHz or faster processor, at
least 128 MB of physical RAM, and 124MB of free disk space. Java supports Windows,
Mac OS X, Linux, and Solaris. We will be writing software using Java Version 8.

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
$<$Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the 
developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware 
limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other 
applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel 
operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security 
considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the 
customer’s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered 
software).$>$

\section{User Documentation}

The following documentation components will be delivered along with the software:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item UI Design
    \item User's Manual
\end{enumerate}

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

$<$List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the 
requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial 
components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating 
environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions 
are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the 
project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to 
reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for 
example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).$>$


\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
There will a be discrete user interface for each System Module. These user
interfaces will be capable of running seperately, but may also be run together
in order to show the full functionality of each module and how it interfaces
behind-the-scenes with other modules.

UI Prototypes for each module are shown in the UI Design document. The User's
Manual further elaborates on operational details and how users are expected to
interface with each module.


\chapter{System Modules}

\section{Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) Office Module}

\subsection{Description}
The CTC office module is the part of the software that sends trains from the 
train yard. A human dispatcher can view information of the entire system 
from the CTC office. The module can operate in automatic mode, where is dispatches 
and routes trains according to a set schedule, or manual mode where trains are 
dispatched by the dispatcher.

\subsection{Interface}
The CTC module interacts with two "users," a human dispatcher and the wayside controller 
module. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The module must display information on the current track layout and currently 
  deployed trains to the dispatcher. 
  \item The dispatcher can manually schedule trains for the CTC to deploy. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The CTC gives suggested speed and authority for each train to the wayside 
  controller module. 
  \item The wayside controller module will send the CTC information on which pieces of 
  track are occupied by trains. 
\end{itemize}
There is also a communication link between the stations of the track model and the 
CTC to communicate information on passenger throughput.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
$<$Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature.  
These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user 
to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case.  
Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or 
invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous, 
verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary 
information is not yet available.$>$
\begin{itemize}
  \item The CTC module must display the following track information. Some information 
  will be displayed in a dynamic map view and detailed information will be displayed 
  when selecting a block in the map view.  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Block ID
	\item Block Region
	\item Occupied State
	\item Speed Limit
	\item Length
	\item Grade
	\item Elevation
	\item Block Passible (Yes, Broken, or Maintainance)
	\item Heater (On, Disabled, N/A)
	\item Underground/Above Ground
	\item Light Information (when applicable)
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Light State (Super Green, Green, Yellow, Red)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Switch Information (when applicable)
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Switch ID
	  \item Switch State
	\end{itemize}
	\item Station Information (when applicable)
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Station Name
	  %\Number of Passengers Waiting (Do we need this? Can we even get this info?)
	\end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \item The CTC module must let the dispatcher close and open blocks for maintainance.
  \item The CTC module must be able to operate in manual or automatic mode. In manual 
  mode, all trains will be manually dispatched by the human dispatcher. In automatic 
  mode, trains will be dispatched by the module according to a schedule.
  \item The CTC module must let the dispatcher upload a schedule to be followed in 
  automatic mode.
  \item The CTC module must let the dispatcher view and edit the schedule in manual mode.
  \item The CTC module must display the following train information. Some information 
  will be displayed in a dynamic map view and detailed information will be displayed 
  when selecting a train in the map view.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Train ID
    \item Suggested Speed
    \item Given Authority
    \item Origin
    \item Destination
  \end{itemize}
  \item The CTC module must display the ambient temperature.
  \item The CTC module must display the current passenger throughput based on tickets
  sold at each station.
\end{itemize}
