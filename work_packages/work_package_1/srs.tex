\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
The product whose software requirements are specified in this document is the
Training Montage Rail Simulator (TMRS). This SRS covers the functional and 
non-functional requirements, design contraints, and funcitonal limitations that
will be observed during the development of this project. This SRS will encompass
the entire system, and will include specific requirements, constraints, and 
limitations for each sub-system.

\section{Document Conventions}
The following acronyms will be used throughout the paper:
\begin{description}
  \item[TMRS] Training Montage Rail Simulator
  \item[Failure] A subsystem has failed when it allows two locomotives to share a block.
  \item[Unsafe] A situation or subsystem is unsafe if failure is made possible by said situation or subsystem.
  \item[Vital] A vital subsystem is one which shall not allow unsafe output.
\end{description}

$<$Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when 
writing this SRS, such as fonts or highlighting that have special significance.  
For example, state whether priorities  for higher-level requirements are assumed 
to be inherited by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement 
is to have its own priority.$>$

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This document is intended as a part of the contractual agreement between Training
Montage and their client for the TMRS software package. It will be used as reference
by developers, project managers, testers, and the client.

It is suggested that the user read over the project scope and perspective, then
visit the UI design prototype included in the Appendix. The UI design prototype 
will give a good sense of how users will interact with the software, and of what
capabilities are provided by the system. After reviewing the UI design prototype,
proceed to read the rest of the document in the order that it's presented.

\section{Project Scope}
$<$Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, 
including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to 
corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document 
is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.$>$

\section{References}
$<$List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may 
include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements 
specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide 
enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, 
including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.$>$


\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
$<$Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.  
For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product 
family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained 
product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the 
requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and 
identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major 
components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external 
interfaces can be helpful.$>$

\section{Product Functions}
$<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user 
perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary 
(such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them 
understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of 
related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram 
or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
This produce is expected to be used by the following classes of users:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Dispatcher
    \item Wayside Engineer
    \item Train Conductor
\end{enumerate}

It is expected none of these user classes to have technical expertise. As such,
each user will be provided with an graphical user interface that allows full
functionality of each module.

It is, however, expected that Wayside Engineers are experts both on a section
of track and in writing PLC code. All uploaded code is considered vital.

\section{Operating Environment}
The software will operate on the Java Virtual Machine. The Java Virtual Machine
can be installed on computers with a Pentium 2 266 MHz or faster processor, at
least 128 MB of physical RAM, and 124MB of free disk space. Java supports Windows,
Mac OS X, Linux, and Solaris. We will be writing software using Java Version 8.

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
$<$Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the 
developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware 
limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other 
applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel 
operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security 
considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the 
customer’s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered 
software).$>$

\section{User Documentation}

The following documentation components will be delivered along with the software:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item UI Design
    \item User's Manual
\end{enumerate}

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

$<$List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the 
requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial 
components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating 
environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions 
are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the 
project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to 
reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for 
example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).$>$


\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
There will a be discrete user interface for each System Module. These user
interfaces will be capable of running seperately, but may also be run together
in order to show the full functionality of each module and how it interfaces
behind-the-scenes with other modules.

UI Prototypes for each module are shown in the UI Design document. The User's
Manual further elaborates on operational details and how users are expected to
interface with each module.

\chapter{System Modules}
This application shall be made of 5 separate modules, each of which a team member shall own.
These shall be the Centralized Traffic Controller, Wayside / Track Controller, Track Model, Train Model, and Train Controller.
These modules shall have strict communication constraints and be architected in the following way.

\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
$<$If there are performance requirements for the product under various 
circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the 
developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the 
timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific 
as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual 
functional requirements or features.$>$

\section{Safety Requirements}
$<$Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss, damage, or 
harm that could result from the use of the product. Define any safeguards or 
actions that must be taken, as well as actions that must be prevented. Refer to 
any external policies or regulations that state safety issues that affect the 
product’s design or use. Define any safety certifications that must be 
satisfied.$>$

\section{Security Requirements}
$<$Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use 
of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define 
any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or 
regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any 
security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.$>$

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
$<$Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be 
important to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are: 
adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, 
maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, 
and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when 
possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, 
such as ease of use over ease of learning.$>$

\section{Business Rules}
$<$List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or 
roles can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not 
functional requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional 
requirements to enforce the rules.$>$


\chapter{Other Requirements}

acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans 
multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to 
a single project in each SRS.$>$

\section{Appendix B: Analysis Models}
$<$Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow 
diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship 
diagrams.$>$

\section{Appendix C: To Be Determined List}
