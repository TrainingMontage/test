\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
The product whose software requirements are specified in this document is the
Training Montage Rail Simulator (TMRS). This SRS covers the functional and
non-functional requirements, design constraints, and functional limitations that
will be observed during the development of this project. This SRS will encompass
the entire system, and will include specific requirements, constraints, and
limitations for each sub-system.

\section{Document Conventions}
The following acronyms will be used throughout the paper:

\begin{description}
  \item[TMRS] Training Montage Rail Simulator
  \item[Failure] A subsystem has failed when it allows two locomotives to share a block.
  \item[Unsafe] A situation or subsystem is unsafe if failure is made possible by said situation or subsystem.
  \item[Vital] A vital subsystem is one which shall not allow unsafe output.
  \item[PLC] Programmable Logic Controller, a hardware platform which operates solely on binary values, controlled by code given by a user. The term PLC will be used interchangeably to refer to the device and the code which runs on it.
  \item[CTC] Centralized Traffic Control, the module that represents the main dispatcher office.
  \item[Block] The track is partitioned into blocks, what is considered an indivisible unit of track. A block has one speed limit, one grade, one altitude, no switches, and at most one train occupying it.
\end{description}

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
TMRS is a simulation and prototype bid for the North Shore Extension presented by the City of Pittsburgh, PA.
In this capacity, the software is intended to allow users view of how a completed North Shore Extension control system would operate, and serve to inform the development of the system to be deployed, although no code will be shared between this prototype and the completed system.

There are five major modules which make up this system, for which the individual requirements will be specified in chapter 4.

\begin{description}
    \item[Centralized Traffic Control (CTC)] The CTC office module is the part of the software that sends trains from the train yard.
    A human dispatcher can view information of the entire system from the CTC office.
    The module can operate in automatic mode, where it dispatches and routes trains according to a set schedule, or manual mode where trains are dispatched by the dispatcher.
    \item[Wayside / Track Controller] This module is a vital computing platform.
    The Wayside Controller module is a simulation of the many wayside controllers which sit next to track, and operate the switches and lights on the track, and provide the train traveling with within its region safe speed and authority.
    \item[Track Model] The system shall have a model of the transit system track layout. This module is \textbf{not} vital.
    \item[Train Model]
    \item[Train Controller] This module is responsible for safely dictating the train's speed by way of controlling its power, as well as controlling some smaller tasks like light and door control, and feedback about current and approaching stations. This module is VITAL.
\end{description}


%$<$Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.
%For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product
%family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained
%product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the
%requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and
%identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major
%components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external
%interfaces can be helpful.$>$

\section{Product Functions}
The software shall:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Allow a dispatcher to perform tasks such as create, view, edit, and execute schedules, and also manually dispatch a train to a location.
        \item Allow a wayside engineer to control the operation of switches and lights with PLC code.
        \item Allow a locomotive engineer to observe automatic train operation, and also allow manual train control.
        \item Move trains to their destination always in a SAFE manner.
    \end{enumerate}

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
This produce is expected to be used by the following classes of users:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Dispatcher
    \item Wayside Engineer
    \item Train Conductor
\end{enumerate}

It is expected none of these user classes to have technical expertise. As such,
each user will be provided with an graphical user interface that allows full
functionality of each module.

It is, however, expected that Wayside Engineers are experts both on a section
of track and in writing PLC code. All uploaded code is considered vital.

\section{Operating Environment}
The software will operate on the Java Virtual Machine. The Java Virtual Machine
can be installed on computers with a Pentium 2 266 MHz or faster processor, at
least 128 MB of physical RAM, and 124MB of free disk space. Java supports Windows,
Mac OS X, Linux, and Solaris. We will be writing software using Java Version 8.

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
\end{enumerate}
%$<$Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the
%developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware
%limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other
%applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel
%operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security
%considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the
%customerâ€™s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered
%software).$>$

\section{User Documentation}

The following documentation components will be delivered along with the software:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item UI Design
    \item User's Manual
\end{enumerate}

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

%$<$List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the
%requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial
%components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating
%environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions
%are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the
%project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to
%reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for
%example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).$>$


\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
There will a be discrete user interface for each System Module. These user
interfaces will be capable of running separately, but may also be run together
in order to show the full functionality of each module and how it interfaces
behind-the-scenes with other modules.

UI Prototypes for each module are shown in the UI Design document. The User's
Manual further elaborates on operational details and how users are expected to
interface with each module.


%
%$<$Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software
%product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards
%or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout
%constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on
%every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on.
%Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of
%the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface
%specification.$>$

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
%$<$Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between
%the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include
%the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions
%between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be
%used.$>$

\section{Software Interfaces}

%documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols.
%Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data
%sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a
%global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an
%implementation constraint.$>$

\section{Communications Interfaces}
%$<$Describe the requirements associated with any communications functions
%required by this product, including e-mail, web browser, network server
%communications protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define any pertinent
%message formatting. Identify any communication standards that will be used, such

\section{Train Controller}

\subsection{Description}
This module is responsible for safely dictating the train's speed by way of controlling its power, as well as controlling some smaller tasks like light and door control, and feedback about current and approaching stations. This module is VITAL.

This vital controller receives a suggested speed and compares it to its own calculated maximum safe speed and selects the lower of the two values to relay to the Train Model. As the train's speed is controlled by its current power, the Train Controller converts the new speed into a power requirement (or a brake setting, if needed).  The train controller also dictates when the lights and doors should be activated, and announces when the train is approaching a station or has stopped at a station.

\subsection{Interface}
The Train Controller receives a suggested speed from the Wayside Controller. This information will be processed and relayed to the Train Model as a power setting.  The controller sends signals to turn lights on or off, and open doors on either side of the train.  This module receives feedback from the Train Model in the from of its current speed and/or power.  The Train Controller also knows the train's current authority in the form of distance in miles.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Train Controller shall have an algorithm capable of calculating a maximum safe speed for the train in question.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The maximum safe speed shall be the maximum speed that can be fully arrested in the minimum safe breaking distance.
        \item The train controller shall consider the train's mass, current speed, and current authority when calculating this speed.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item The Train Controller shall select a safe speed for the train.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The Train Controller shall choose the suggested speed or its own calculated maximum safe speed.
        \item By default, the lower of the two speeds will be chosen for the train.
        \item The Train Controller shall allow a manual mode for the driver of the train to manually input a speed.  This speed shall not exceed the speed suggested by the Wayside Controller.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item The module, once it has chosen a speed for the train, will require an algorithm to convert that desired speed into either (1) a power setting for the train, or (2) an application of the brake for a certain amount of time.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item This algorithm shall use the train's current and desired kinetic energy combined with a time constraint to determine the power required to achieve the desired speed.
        \item This algorithm shall also take grade into account.
        \item The details of this algorithm are TBD.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item The Train Controller must dictate that lights should be turned on or off.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The Train Controller shall control lights based on a daily schedule.
        \item It is the responsibility of the Train Model to execute these instructions.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item The Train Controller must dictate that train doors should open.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The Train Controller shall only open doors when the train is stopped.
        \item Doors can be opened on the left or the right, or both.
        \item The Train Controller shall read which doors should be open from beacons approaching each station.
        \item In the event of an emergency stop and train evacuation, the Train Controller shall send the command to open whichever doors are appropriate, given the situation at hand.
        \item It is the responsibility of the Train Model to execute these instructions.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item The Train Controller must display stops and stations.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The upcoming stop and the distance to that stop shall be read from an RFID sensor one block before the station or stop's location.
        \item The Train Controller shall display the stop as soon as it receives and deciphers the information from the RFID sensor.
        \item The Train Controller shall display the information until the train has physically left that station.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
The simulation software must be able to simulate at 10 times wall clock speed.
This will allow quicker evaluation of a simulated circumstances. The simulation

%and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when
%possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes,
%such as ease of use over ease of learning.$>$

\section{Business Rules}
%$<$List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or
%roles can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not
%functional requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional
%requirements to enforce the rules.$>$

%include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal
%requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections
%that are pertinent to the project.$>$

\section{Appendix A: Glossary}
%see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
%$<$Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including
%acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans
%multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to
%a single project in each SRS.$>$

\section{Appendix B: Analysis Models}
%$<$Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow
%diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship
